abstract: "This study aims to investigate the impact of different formats of health-related information on consumers’ food choice behavior. First, we conducted an online choice experiment using mandarin orange as the focal product. To compare the effects of different formats of health-related information, we randomly assigned participants into three informational treatment groups prior to the choice experiment: a group that did not receive any health claim of mandarin orange consumption (control), a group received a general health claim only containing health benefits of mandarin orange consumption (partial informational treatment), and a group received a detailed health claim containing health benefits of mandarin orange consumption and its related substance (full informational treatment). Then, we studied consumers’ food purchasing behavior by estimating a generalized mixed logit model in both preference and WTP space. We found that other attributes of mandarin oranges become less important in consumers’ food purchasing decision and consumers are more likely to purchase mandarin oranges on average when we provide them more information on health benefits of mandarin orange consumption. However, the detailed health benefits information may decrease the consistency of consumers’ healthy food choice."
